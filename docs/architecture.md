# System Architecture

## Overview
The Lunar EcoCycle system is designed as a modular architecture to facilitate scalability, maintainability, and integration of various components. This document outlines the key components and their interactions.

## Components
1. **Advanced Waste Sorting and Processing Facility (AWSF)**
   - Responsible for sorting and processing lunar waste.
   - Interfaces with the ISRU Module for resource recovery.

2. **In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) Module**
   - Extracts and processes resources such as water and oxygen.
   - Works closely with the BLSS for resource distribution.

3. **Bioregenerative Life Support System (BLSS)**
   - Maintains air, water, and food production.
   - Integrates with the EHSS for energy management.

4. **3D Printing and Recycling Facility (3DPF)**
   - Utilizes lunar regolith and waste materials for manufacturing.
   - Collaborates with the AWSF for material input.

5. **Energy Harvesting and Storage System (EHSS)**
   - Provides reliable power supply to all components.
   - Interfaces with RAS for energy management.

6. **Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS)**
   - Automates operations and maintenance tasks.
   - Works with AIDA for predictive maintenance.

7. **Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA)**
   - Analyzes data for system optimization and predictive maintenance.
   - Interfaces with all components for data collection and analysis.
